# libqd is quad-double precison library for Windows.

##Introduction
QD package is written by by Yozo Hida, Xiaoye S. Li, David H. Bailey and others in LBNL.  
This libqd is a port the QD for windows.
It will be added enhancement and improvement to the original QD package on this repository.
This package supports both a double-double datatype (approx. 32 decimal digits) and a quad-double datatype (approx. 64 decimal digits).
The computational library is written in C++. C++ high-level language interfaces are provided to permit one to use convert an existing C++ program to use the library with only minor changes to the source code.

##What is different?
Omitted C language support.  
Specified for Windows.

Part of the proposition was merged officaly.
